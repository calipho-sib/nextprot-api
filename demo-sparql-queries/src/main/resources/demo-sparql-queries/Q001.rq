#title:Proteins phosphorylated and located in the cytoplasm
#comment:In this query we use the keyword "Phophorylation" (KW-0597) and the UniProt subcellur location ontology term "Cytoplasm" (SL-0886).
#comment:Using the "childOf" allows to select for subcellular locations that are, in that ontology, children of cytoplasm like for example "Cell cortex".
