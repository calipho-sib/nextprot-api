REPORT DOCUMENT ON THE NEXTPROT RDF MODEL MODIFICATIONS FOR THE NAME CLASS
Author: Vincenzo Daponte.

The modifications have affected the velocity templates that produces the .ttl files referring to the Entry names,
in particular the ones contributing to the production of the "Overview" of each Entry.

The velocity template files concerned by this modifications are:
- entity-name.ttl.vm
- overview.ttl.vm
- schema-ontology-list.ttl.vm
- chromosomal-location-list.ttl.vm
- gene-name.ttl.vm (NEW FILE!)

The modifications to these templates aim to implement the following tasks:
- Include the missing classes and relationships included in the modifications proposed, .
    implemented in the schema-ontology-list.ttl.vm file;
- Build a new routine to build the names according to the modifications, names to be listed and correctly linked in the Entry overview.
    This routine involves the overview.ttl.vm file and the entity-name file for the entity names and other names besides gene names.
- For gene names specifics and examples were given, these specifics are in the .pdf file "How_to_add_gene_and_ORF_names_to_velocity_templates_Vincenzo_Daponte.pdf".
    To reproduce these specifics and the examples given a special "Gene Name" section has been created in the overview.ttl.vm that calls the newly created gene-name.ttl.vm file.
    In this file are implemented the paths to produces the gene name specific individuals such as the ORF name individuals for all the name synonyms.
- In the chromosomal-location-list.ttl.vm has been corrected the Name specific class declaration into GeneName.

The listed files are updated in this brach and in this folder are available the overview.ttl files for the entries NX_A2IDD5, NX_A4D1E9, NX_A6QL64 and NX_O75121 also present as examples in the specifications .pdf file.
